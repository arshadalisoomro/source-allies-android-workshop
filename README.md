This is the demo project we are using for our Source Allies Inc. Android workshop. The backend and client are all set up, we will be going through and making the app module.

The different branches are for the different stages of the project:

part_1: We will create and implement a login activity to register with the service
part_2: We will read in conversations and display a conversation list to the user
part_3: We will receive messages through push notifications
part_4: We will look at individual conversations
part_5: We will allow for replying to conversations
part_6: We will allow for compose new messages to new recipients
