/**
 * This is the adapter to fill the message list for a thread.
 *
 * Adapter's are annoying in Android. Complex ones take a log of code and you just want to get to the
 * end of it to see the results... But, it isn't difficult work.
 *
 * What to learn from this:
 *      - This is just an ArrayAdapter. Android has a new RecyclerView class (New in 2014) that CAN be
 *          more effient, but it is also more complex with lot of different peices, they are a lot more powerful though.
 *          ArrayAdapter's and CursorAdapter's are simple, and can be made very efficient as well.
 *          Recycler views are based off of the ViewHolder pattern that originated in basic Array and Cursor Adapters.
 *          It is the pattern that we use in these classes.
 *
 *      - ViewHolder keeps an instance of the different attributes of your views so that you do not have
 *          to find them within your layouts for every single element in the list (using the findViewById() function).
 *          It recycles the views from the already inflated layout and reuses their tags.
 *          Hard to explain, so lets check out the code.

    /**
     * TODO:
     *
     *      1.) fill in the message_item.xml
     *          - I just used one TextView, nothing fancy, but feel free to check out the Message class
     *              to see what information is available to you
     *      2.) Fill in the newView() method.
     *          - Extremely similar to the ThreadArrayAdapter method
     *      3.) Fill in the bindView(..) method
     *          - You can use LinearLayout.setGravity(Gravity.RIGHT or Gravity.LEFT) to help you
     *              with the alignment of the messages depending on whether they are sent or incoming messages
     *              for the current user
     *      4.) Fill in the getView(...) method
     *          - Again, very similar to the ThreadArrayAdapter
